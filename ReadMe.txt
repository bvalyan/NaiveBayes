Instructions: If using mushroom dataset, the files are located in the folder, therefore, as long as the files are in the same folder.
If using a different dataset with different classifications, the 'p' and 'e' variables in the code must be adjusted as such. Otherwise,
to run your files insert the data to be classified in "fullData" and the training data in "data2" at the last line of code, "print(classify("fullData", "data2"))"
The output will be in the console.
